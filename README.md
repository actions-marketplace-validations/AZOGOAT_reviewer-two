Named for academia's Reviewer #2: reads everything, questions everything, approves nothing.

A GitHub Action that reviews pull requests and posts the result as a normal GitHub review: inline comments, suggestion blocks where the fix is obvious, and a COMMENT or REQUEST_CHANGES verdict. It never approves, and it cannot touch your code: the token only gets contents read and pull-requests write.

Before commenting it explores the repo with read-only tools, then re-checks every finding and drops the ones it cannot defend. The bias is fewer, better comments: nits fold into the review body instead of inline noise, anything a linter would catch is skipped, and each finding cites the rule it breaks.

Works with any language. Conventions come from your repo, not the tool.

## Where it fits

There are plenty of AI code review tools out there. Here is what makes this one worth your workflow file:

- **No platform, no server, no subscription.** One Action, one workflow file, done. You bring your own API key and pay your own bill, which for a mid-size PR is the price of a coffee, not a seat license.
- **It reviews where your team already argues about code.** Commit-time CLIs and editor plugins catch things early on your machine; Reviewer Two shows up on the PR page as a reviewer you request like any other, and its verdict lands in the same place a human's would.
- **Invited, never uninvited.** No drive-by comments on every push. It runs when someone asks, double-checks every finding before posting, and a re-request picks up where it left off instead of repeating itself.

Want dashboards, metrics, and lint-as-you-type? Not this tool. This one does what Reviewer #2 has always done: show up when summoned, read everything, and say exactly what is wrong.

## Setup

Two ways to run it.

### Label trigger (solo)

Reviews post as github-actions. Add `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [labeled]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      pull_number:
        required: true
concurrency:
  group: ai-review-${{ inputs.pull_number || github.event.pull_request.number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
  review:
    if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || github.event.label.name == 'ai-review'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
      issues: read
    steps:
      - name: Validate PR number
        if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch'
        env:
          PULL_NUMBER: ${{ inputs.pull_number }}
        run: |
          [[ "$PULL_NUMBER" =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || { echo "pull_number must be numeric"; exit 1; }
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: refs/pull/${{ inputs.pull_number || github.event.pull_request.number }}/head
      - uses: azogoat/reviewer-two@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          pull_number: ${{ inputs.pull_number || github.event.pull_request.number }}
```

Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret. Then label a PR with `ai-review`, or run the workflow manually with a PR number.

### Review request trigger (team)

Reviews post from a machine account that your team creates and owns, so you request and re-request it exactly like a human reviewer.

1. Create a machine GitHub account under any name you like, and add it to the repo as a collaborator.
2. Give it a fine-grained PAT with Contents: read and Pull requests: read and write. Add Issues: read if you want issues linked in PR descriptions used as context. Store it as the `AI_REVIEWER_TOKEN` secret.
3. Add `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`, with `reviewer_login` set to your account's login:

```yaml
name: AI review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [review_requested]
jobs:
  review:
    uses: azogoat/reviewer-two/.github/workflows/review.yml@v1
    with:
      reviewer_login: your-review-bot
    secrets:
      ai_reviewer_token: ${{ secrets.AI_REVIEWER_TOKEN }}
      anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
```

Requesting a review from that account triggers a run under its identity. Re-requesting runs an incremental pass that only raises new or unresolved issues. Draft PRs are skipped.

## Rules and context

Zero config works: README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and .cursor/rules are picked up automatically. Issues referenced in the PR description (`#123`, `owner/repo#123`, or full URLs) are fetched with their comment threads; refs the token cannot read are skipped.

For per-path rules, add `.github/ai-review/manifest.yml`:

```yaml
context: description.md
always: [rules.md]
rules:
  - file: rules-python.md
    paths: ["**/*.py"]
```

Only rule files matching the PR's changed paths are loaded.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model | claude-opus-4-8 | Any claude-* or gpt-*/o* model id |
| max_tool_calls | 50 | Exploration cap; a runaway guard, raise it for large repos |
| exploration_token_budget | unset | Optional total token cap; when spent, the review wraps up early instead of failing |
| max_inline_comments | 15 | Extra findings collapse into the review body |
| inline_severity_threshold | minor | Minimum severity posted inline; nits never post inline |
| request_changes_threshold | major | Minimum severity for a REQUEST_CHANGES verdict |
| reviewer_login | unset | Login of your machine account; required for team mode |
| dry_run | false | Log the review instead of posting it |

`github_token`, `anthropic_api_key`, `openai_api_key`, and `pull_number` appear in the examples above; see [action.yml](action.yml) for details.

## Model and cost

The default is the strongest Claude model because review quality is the whole point; a deep review of a mid-size PR lands around 1 to 3 USD. Any repo can set a cheaper `model`. GPT models need only the model id and an `openai_api_key` secret; there are no separate code paths.
